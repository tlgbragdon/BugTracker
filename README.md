# BugTracker
## A Software Bug Tracking Application

As a Coder Foundry bootcamp project, I built this fully functional MVC software bug tracking web application from scratch. 
In addition to creating, updating, and assigning tickets, it handles secure file upload functionality for approved file types. 
Implemented using .NET MVC 5 with code-first database and includes user-level and role-level security. 
Database interaction is accomplished through LINQ to Entity Framework. 
Composed a responsive front-end design using HTML5, and a Bootstrap template. 

Demo the application from any number of roles (Admin, Project Manager, Developer, or Submitter) at: https://bragdonbugtracker.azurewebsites.net/Account/DemoLogin
